# CityPop
Work application test written by me for WeKnowIT.

# How to use
To use this application, you need to have Expo on your computer. If you do not already have this, you can follow their install guide here: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

First, download the repository. Once the files are on your computer, open up the terminal, and navigate to the folder containing this repository using the command "cd FILE_PATH_HERE". Finally, write "expo start" and wait for the files to compile. There should be a QR code in the terminal which can be scanned by the Expo Go app, making it available to use on your phone.

# Functionality
The app has functionality to search for the population of cities. One can also search for countries, and recieve five sample cities from that country to search the population for.
